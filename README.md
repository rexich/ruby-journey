# Notes on programming using Ruby

Here I will describe my journey in learning the Ruby programming language.
The book I use is "Programming Ruby" (The Pragmatic Programmer's Guide).
This repository will be regularly updated with personal notes and code
from the examples, as well as my own simple (and in the future, not so simple)
programs.

Please refer to the [notes](notes/) for more details. The code will be [here](code/). :bear:
